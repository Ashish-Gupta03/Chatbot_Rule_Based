# Chatbot_Rule_Based
* This repository contains conversational agent code which uses specification file to make agent behave in a generic way and is limited to mobile recharge systems. It's specification file contains links to other files which are basically kept as json files and one can use them in generic way to replace them with the URL's which will send a proper json format.

* This conversational agent parses user input and finds appropriate response from intelligence engine using JSON and NLP.

* Response will be sent back to user via REST API and the same will be displayed in UI.

* The file "chatInterface.py" is the main file which needs to be run to start the chat application.
