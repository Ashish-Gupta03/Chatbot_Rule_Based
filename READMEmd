This repository contains chatbot code which uses specification file to make chatbot behave in a generic way and is limited to mobile recharge systems. It's specification file contains links to other files which are basically kept as json files and one can use them in generic way to replace them with the URL's which will send a proper json format.
This chatbot parses user input and finds appropriate response from intelligence engine using JSON and NLP(not used currently but can scale if large amount of data is available).
Response will be sent back to user via REST API and the same will be displayed in UI.

The file "chatInterface.py" is the main file which needs to be run to start the chat application.
